# Trivial-Code

## Description

This trivia game is an interactive web application that tests the users coding knowledge through a series of multiple choice and short answer questions. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, the game provides users with a fun way to study by answering trivia questions across various topics. The game features a landing page with instructions on how to play, a leaderboard of stats pulled from local storage, and a button linked to the trivia game. The trivia game first asks the user for their username and then begins a countdown timer to build excitement. The game includes score tracking, instant feedback on user responses, and a question clock to display how much time remains to answer the question.
